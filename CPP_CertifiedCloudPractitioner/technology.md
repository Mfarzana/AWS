## AWS Core Services
### IAM
AWS **Identity and Access Management** (IAM) enables you to **manage access** to AWS services and resources securely. Using IAM, you can create and manage **AWS users and groups, and use permissions to allow and deny their access to AWS resources**. IAM is a feature of your AWS account offered at no additional charge. You will be charged only for use of other AWS services by your users.
### Amazon EC2
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud. Amazon EC2 **provides different instance (as servers)** types to enable you to choose the CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity that you need **to run your applications**.
#### SSM 
AWS Systems Manager or Simple System Manager is an **AWS service** that you can **use to view and control your infrastructure on AWS**. Systems Manager simplifies resource and application management, shortens the time to detect and resolve operational problems, and helps you operate and manage your AWS infrastructure securely at scale
