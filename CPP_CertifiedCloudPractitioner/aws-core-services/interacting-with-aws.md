## IAM
AWS **Identity and Access Management** (IAM) enables you to **manage access** to AWS services and resources securely. 
Using IAM, you can create and manage **AWS users and groups, and use permissions to allow and deny their access to AWS resources**.
IAM is a feature of your AWS account offered at no additional charge. You will be charged only for use of other AWS services by your users.
